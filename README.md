# Protein-folding-quantum-algorithms
Hybrid quantum-classical simulations of protein folding on simplified lattice models. Implements the CVaR-optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) from Robert et al. (2021) to predict low-energy configurations for short peptide sequences and benchmarks them against classical baselines.
