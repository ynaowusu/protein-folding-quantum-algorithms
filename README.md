# Protein-folding-quantum-algorithms
Hybrid quantum-classical simulations of protein folding on simplified lattice models. Implements the CVaR-optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) from Robert et al. (2021) to predict low-energy configurations for short peptide sequences and benchmarks them against classical baselines.

Team Members: Elhaam Bhuiyan , Deborah Olaniyi, Yna Owusu

##  Quick-start with Google Colab

### 1 Open the notebook
Every cell can be run top-to-bottom without edits.

### 2 Clone the repository <small>(first code cell)</small>
```python
!git clone https://github.com/ynaowusu/protein-folding-quantum-algorithms.git
%cd protein-folding-quantum-algorithms
